    Idle stage added; Turning badge over goes to idle
    
    This requires and extra bit set in acclerometer setup. May want to
    debounce the orientation changes to make it a bit smoother and user
    friendly.

    More GoL support; Stage function ptr
    
    New IR sending methods were added and put to use. The usb version can
    now send out food or attacks and the a badge in GoL mode will respond.
    With either the section win (food) or a new "hurt" led and audio
    sequence (when the badge is attacked). Just an early version, lots
     of features needed, but the proof is there.

    Moved un-manchestering and packet unpack out of stages
    
    Ping no longer handled individually by each stage, the main loop will
    setup up the response and enqueue it. If not a ping, the response is
    left to the stage. Greatly simplifies and cleans up stage code.

    Basic game of life mechanics added to licing stage
    
    HP based on accel values (these will be populated from the balance
    stage, though we could poll accelerometer on stage setup). Once badge hp
    lower than 15, piezo starts buzzing.

    In the peer count stage, the leds display the number of peers you've met.

    Peer Count request-respond working
    
    Early stages, but it works, still a few things to be implemented for
    this stage though.
    
    Also added a null led_seq, just an empty method to direct the led_seq
    pointer to if you want to end led sequences. Didn't think setting it to
    null was a good idea, but maybe it would be okay...

    Led sequences with function pointer; cleaning up
    
    To do a led sequence, simple enqueue an led_ev and then set the led_seq
    function pointer to the function to be called.
    
    Some other aspects of the code should probably get similar treatment

    PeerCount Stage added with sonar led sequence
    
    the stage following the cylon seek will be a peer-seeking stage; users
    have to face another user and initiate a communication (maybe using the
    button). See doc for details.

    Base protocol support and features demoing it
    
    Game code now responds to a 0x03:0x01 ir message. USB runtime can enter
    "base-station" mode by pressing 't', then press c to send out a cylon
    seek message. This should allow us to script the base stations, allowing
    us to adjust the rate and what's actually being sent externally rather
    than recompiling.

    Support for IR receiving in Game code
    
    externed relavent variables and included a simple test in the cylon
    stage to prove that IR works in the game. This test works great, next
    step is to make some of the more general meothds used in user.c
    available to game.c.

    Added/changed sound to sequences/stages
    
    welcome sequence sound plays well with the leds. sectionWin sequence now
    works and sounds okay. Also, added audio queues to the fib stage; beeps
    per a fib numbers, this should help people realize that they need zero
    and two ones.

    Intended function: if the badge is plugged into usb, then the ProcessIO

    havent been able to test this since my badge's usb seems to be flaky (or
    all my computer's usbs are).
